# Get Started

### Training
We used AlexeyAB's Darknet for Windows to train our model.
Install Darknet [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet).

### Testing
In order to get the FPS, we used a Python adaption of darknet [here](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow/tree/master/darkflow).


### Web Implementation
